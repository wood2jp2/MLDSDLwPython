            + 'conda install [package name]'
        - Downloaded zip file for course from sundog-learning.com/machine-learning.
            + This contains jupiter notebook files, interactive ways to expiriment with Python code. You can launch and simulate files, and edit code right in your browser.
            + Running 'jupyter notebook' allows you to launch a local listing of all the files in your browser.

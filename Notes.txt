Section 1: Getting Started
    5. MAC: Installing and Getting Started Using Anaconda and course Materials
        - Installed Anaconda 3.7 for MacOS. Used default settings for pretty much everything.
        - Went to fresh command line, and used anaconda to install tensorflow (make deep neural networks) and pydotplus (visualize decision trees)
            + 'conda install [package name]'
        - Downloaded zip file for course from sundog-learning.com/machine-learning.
            + This contains jupiter notebook files, interactive ways to expiriment with Python code. You can launch and simulate files, and edit code right in your browser.
            + Running 'jupyter notebook' allows you to launch a local listing of all the files in your browser.
        
    10. Intro to Pandas: library of functions, processes tabular data (rows, columns)
        - Sci-kit Learn:  library for machine learning algos, linear regressions, SVM..?
        - SK Learn usually takes data formatted by NumPy
        - Pandas to load in/manipulate data, translate to NumPy array that gets fed into SKLearn
            + This will result in a 'dataframe'.
            + data frames have methods like:
                1. df.head(): shows you the first given number of rows
                2. df.tail(): shows you the last given number of columns
                3. df.shape: returns tuple of (rows, columns)
                4. df.size: number of columns (rows x columns)
                5. len(df): rows length
                6. df.columns: returns array of column names
                7. df.sort_values(['Column to sort by'])
                8. df['Column Name'].value_counts(): returns number of occurences for each unique value
            + extract values by column using df['Column Name'] or multiple columns with df[['Column One', 'Column Two']]
